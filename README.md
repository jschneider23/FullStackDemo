### What was the purpose of this web app project?

The purpose of this project was to be a **personal side project** that refreshed, sharpened, and further developed my skills in **full-stack development** (as well as the languages and tools used in the project individually) during a pandemic that interrupted my original post-graduation plans.  Given that we had, and still have, no idea how much longer this pandemic might last, I wanted to work on a practical side project for an average of an **hour or two each day** so that I could use my time during the pandemic productively and **gain more experience, knowledge, and insight** as a full-stack developer.

This project was also a great opportunity to learn more about a personal interest of mine: **the stock market.**  I eventually plan to develop a predictive model for personal investments down the line, and this project was able to give me experience with APIs I likely want to use as well as **methods of handling, processing, and understanding raw stock market data**.  My involvement with this project will serve as invaluable resource and reference when I do decide to develop that for myself, after further research and experience of course.

### What languages, technologies, and skills were used?
**Data API**: TD Ameritrade's Developer APIs *(app licensed under my personal account)*<br>
**Backend**: *Python 3.7.3* with the main libraries being *Pandas, Requests, Plotly, and Datetime*<br>
**Framework**: *Flask Web Framework*<br>
**Frontend/UI**: Plain *JavaScript*, *jQuery*, and *HTML/CSS (using Bootstrap 4)*

### What challenges did I face and how did I overcome them or deal with them?

The largest problem I faced wasn't an issue with code, development, or a bug: it was the **COVID-19 Pandemic**.  The pandemic has hit everyone hard and differently, whether we or a loved one has actually contracted it or not.  While I have been fortunate so far as to not contract it myself, the pandemic has certainly **impacted my mental health, motivation, and efficiency**.  While the manner in which it has affected these things is a private matter, it certainly had the largest impact on this project out of any of the challenges I faced.  Despite it making things more difficult for me, I pushed through it with **great dedication and persistance** to **achieve the purposes and goals I set** for this project and I am pleased to present the final product of my work.

The next largest issue I faced was **undocumented and unexpected functionality when requesting TD Ameritrade's Option Chains API** that I needed to handle on my end to **fulfill expected and desired implementation and functionality**.  You can read more about this specific API [here](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/option-chains/apis/get/marketdata/chains), but to summarize the API and where the actual functionality differs than what is expected:
